## Sinopsis

```{r load_libs, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(plotly)
data(mtcars)

```

## Plots
Now we can go for the plots:
### Scatter Plots

Basic scatter plot:
```{r basic_scatterplot}
plot_ly(mtcars, x = ~mpg, y = ~hp, mode = 'markers', type = "scatter")
```

Scatter plot with different color:
```{r basic_scatterplot}
plot_ly(mtcars, x = ~mpg, y = ~hp, mode = 'markers', type = "scatter",color = ~cyl)
```
